Context
-------

This document defines the inventory. The inventory is a list of items and
actions. Their relationships are defined as well as usage constraints.

Think about how you put together ideas in your head. You connect concepts
knowing resources and processes. For example, how do you make coffee? You know a
coffee machine gives you brewed coffee. (Need machine, grinder, store sells
coffee, other store sells machine, delivery, etc. or coffee shop).

    genesis of a product (prototype phase) on the left to the product being a
    readily available commodity (widely available).

Decision
--------

Operations and definitions of data types or resources can be added to an
inventory.

Consequences
------------

**TODO**

Reduction of duplicated work. One team making black coffee, one with cream. They
both will see the obvious need for a coffee machine, or coffee brewing service.
They can contribute that block to the inventory as an unfinished solution so
that each team can see that is a missing piece they need to collaborate on.

Notes
-----

Interfaces will likely be important in conjunction with definitions. To see
which definitions can be used by operations. Inspecting primitive data types and
other usage characteristics might help here. These other usage characteristics
might be things like, is it a secret. We should allow for annotation of data
with these usage characteristics, and the characteristics themselves should be
able to be stored in the inventory.
